		story: "Washington (CNN) The Senate's historic $2 trillion stimulus package is set for debate on the House floor Friday. The chamber will convene at 9 a.m. to consider the largest emergency aid package in US history in response to the coronavirus outbreak and its economic fallout, following a remarkable 96-0 Senate vote late Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who turns 80 today -- has said she would prefer that the Senate measure is adopted by unanimous consent, which would spare members who are isolating or at risk from having to travel back to Washington. But Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York freshman, is leaving open the option of objecting, potentially forcing House members to return and delaying a vote. Pelosi, however, told reporters that won't happen. \"We will be passing the bill tomorrow,\" she said today, CNN\'s Haley Byrd and Clare Foran report. $250 billion set aside for direct payments to individuals and families, $350 billion in small business loans and $250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits. A major amount of funding for hard-hit hospitals -- $130 billion -- as well as $150 billion for state and local governments that are cash-strapped due to their response to coronavirus. A $500 billion fund for Treasury to provide loans and support for distressed industries. That includes $25 billion for passenger air carriers, $4 billion for cargo air carriers and $17 billion for businesses that work in national security. The rest of the funds, $454 billion, can be spent as loans to businesses, states and municipalities."

The ICUs within Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany are filled with \"critically ill Covid-19 patients,\" Phoebe Putney Health System said in a news release Wednesday. A fourth ICU was previously opened to care for patients not infected with the virus. The system has four medical centers in Albany, Americus and Sylvester, as well as other facilities, but Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital is facing the worst of the pandemic. Of Georgia's 47 deaths from coronavirus, 12 patients had died at the Albany facility as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the hospital system. \"As this public health crisis in southwest Georgia gets more severe, we have been reaching out to other hospitals in our part of the state,\" the system's CEO, Scott Steiner, said. \"I am pleased that every one of our regional partners we spoke to in the last 24 hours agreed to assist by accepting patient transfers from us.\""

There are 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ethiopia, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Authorities in the nation have put in place a raft of measures, including the closure of all borders except to those bringing in essential goods to contain the virus. The government has directed security officials to monitor and enforce a ban on large gatherings and overcrowded public transport to ensure social distancing."

The man, who suffered from hypertension and diabetes, caught the virus domestically, they said, suggesting community transmission of the virus in the South American nation. After announcing its first case on February 26, infection numbers have risen to 291. The figure is expected to multiply in the coming days, but Brazilians continue to get mixed messages from the top.
